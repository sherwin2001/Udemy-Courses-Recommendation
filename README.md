# Udemy-Courses-Recommendation
## A Cloud-Based, Big Data Analytics system to recommend online courses to the user. 

The user enters the name of the course and can obtain more information on it if it exists. If such a course does not exist then the recommendation app recommendeds similar courses or courses which can best fulfill userâ€™s needs.  <br /><br />
User can also enter keywords which can best describe the topics on which he wants the courses (Ex: Finance, Stocks, Excel, Python, etc.)  <br /><br />
The app also displays user ratings, number of users enrolled and whether course is paid or unpaid.  <br /><br />
The project is coded in **Python**, for computation of similarity **Cosine Similarity Matrix** is used and the project is hosted on **Streamlit Cloud**.
